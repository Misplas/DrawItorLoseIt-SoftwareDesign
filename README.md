# Jacobb Foster Mock Software Design Consultation

The Gaming Room, the client, required a web-based version of their game, Draw It or Lose It. The game was initially designed for Android devices. The goal was to expand accessibility by making the game compatible across various platforms. The game is inspired by an 80s game show Win, Lose or Draw, but with particular rule changes, such as guessing stock image renderings in timed rounds with opportunities for other teams to steal answers. 

Particularly I provided a highly detailed overview for The Game Room's operating system architecture. I delve into great detail pertaining to the server side, client side and developmental tools requirements to function efficiently. I touch on the differences between operating systems like Mac, Linux, Windows and Mobile, comparing how they can coagulate with the development requirements.

When writing code for this project, it's the most helpful to utilize UML. Unified Modeling Language made writing code as simple as translating funtions with function calls to java code. To supplement my UML diagram, I wrote a detailed summary of the diagram explaining how it functions specifically. All together these steps helped me to write my code.

If I could revise any part of my document I would revise the recommendations I made to the Client. After learning more about subjects like memory management, operating platforms and computer architecture. I understand that there are specific suggestions that should be provided to the Client that will better aid in the remediation of their software design.

I interpret the user's needs and implemented them in my design by understanding how the user will interact with the interface and the client side development. What actions need to take place on the back-end for the user to be able to see what is supposed to happen on the front end. These considerations are so critical to understanding the user's needs when designing a consultation or a software plan because you are inadvertantly ironing out bugs and errors by building RESTful code.

I apporach designing software with an Agile mindset but also include RESTful thinking for my code. Building code with an Agile mindset enables me to approach the program with a mindset that promotes flexibilty, efficient changes and functional code. Incorporating RESTful standards, RESTful application programming will guide the software; uniform, client-server, stateless, cacheable, layered, and optionally code on demand. With all things in mind, this style will ensure data and functionality are considered resources.
